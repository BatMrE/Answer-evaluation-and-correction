# Geography Question Answering Framework

This project is a Python-based framework designed for answering questions using geographical data. The framework evaluates the quality of answers using the following metrics: Grammar, Lexical Diversity, Phraseology, Matrix-based Phraseology, Vocabulary, Cohesion, and Convention.

## Installation

First, ensure that you have Streamlit installed. You can install it via pip:
```
pip install streamlit
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Set Up OpenAI API Key

Create an OpenAI API key by following the instructions here: [link](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/). Once you have the API key, use it in the `set_openai_api_key()` function in `model.py`.

### Step 2: Run the Application

Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
```
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

After running the application, you will receive a localhost endpoint in your command line or terminal. Open this endpoint in your browser to view the user interface.
